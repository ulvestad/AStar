# A* algorithm
A* algorithm created in java for NTNU course TDT4136 (Introduction to AI)

MapReader.java reads and translates the map from .txt files <br />
AStar.java uses the A* algorithm with Manhatten heuristics to find the shortest path from A to B <br />
AStarCellCost.java builds on AStar.java but have implementation for handling cell cost (e.g.: watercell = 100, roadcell = 1, etc.)
